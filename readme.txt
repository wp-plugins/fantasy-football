Put the fantasy football data from FantasyFootballNerd.com on your website. Automatically updated. Perfect for any fantasy football related website.

== Description ==
Looking to beef up your fantasy football website or blog with automatically-updated content? Add the draft rankings, draft projections, game day weather, injuries, defensive rankings, weekly rankings, weekly projections, bye weeks, draft auction values, NFL depth charts, and more from Fantasy Football Nerd with the official FFN WordPress Fantasy Football Plugin!

== Installation ==
Instructions for implementing the plugin can be found at http://www.fantasyfootballnerd.com/wordpress

First things first - you'll need to download and activate the FFN plugin. From the WordPress Administration screen, click on "Plugins" and look for the Fantasy Football plugin. When you find it, click the Activate link.

In order for the plugin to talk to FantasyFootballNerd.com, you'll need to create a free API key. This key allows your plugin to tell us who you are, what services your account has access to, and allows us to monitor the resources used so that we can continue to provide a responsive platform for everyone.

If you don't have an account at FFN, you'll need to create one, but don't worry - it's quick and easy. If you already have an account, you'll need to sign in to either get your key or to generate one.  Please Note: If you do not generate an API key, the plugin will return dummy data. Dummy data can be useful for making sure that the plugin works, but you'll want to get an API key to return live data.

Next, add your API Key to WordPress. Once you have your API key, go back to your WordPress Administration screen and click on the Settings option. From there, look for the "FFN Settings" link.

Enter your API key into the appropriate box and click "Save Changes". Congratulations - you've just installed the FFN Fantasy Football WordPress plugin! Now it's time to start plugging it into your website!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: How much does it cost?
A: Most of the options are completely free. For example, depth charts, rankings, projections, schedules, and more are free or are provided with limited results (ie, Top 20). If your account on Fantasy Football Nerd limits you to seeing the Top 20, the WordPress plugin will respect that same limitation. If you plan on using the plugin in a commercial capacity, please get a commercial license from FFN.  If you just want to show the free stuff, that's what it was designed for!

Q: What is an API key and why do I need one?
A: An API key is a unique string assigned to you that lets the WordPress plugin talk to FantasyFootballNerd.com. It lets us know who is asking for information, what info they want, and how we should return it. Creating an API key is free and easy.  If you do not have an API key, the WordPress plugin will return cached, dummy data which can be useful for testing but not so useful in a production environment.

Q: Do I have to mention that the data comes from Fantasy Football Nerd?
A: Nope - in fact we'd prefer that you didn't. The plugin is designed to be seamlessly integrated into YOUR website, not ours. There is absolutely no mention of Fantasy Football Nerd in the content.
